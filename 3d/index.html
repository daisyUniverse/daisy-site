        <h1>Notes & Ramblings</h1>
        this is just a little collection of thoughts. I would like to share them with you!<br><br>
        <div class="content">
        <p>
            i want to be something beautiful</br>
            destroyed by love</br></br>

            i want to be a glorious and vast church</br>
            crumbling, and covered in flowering vines</br></br>

            i want to be a forgotten statue of a figure lost to time</br>
            pet for good luck to a miraculous shine</br>

            <p>
                I won't let my naivety get in the way of my dreaming<br><br>

                I'm aware of it of course <br>
                but that just means that the best I can hope for is to learn <br>
                and that's the thing that I love to do the most <br>
                so as far as I'm concerned <br>
                that just makes me a hungry pup in a buffet<br>
